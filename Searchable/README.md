# Searchable

- iOS can add a search bar to our views using the searchable() modifier, and we can bind a string property to it to filter our data as the user types.

- The localizedCaseInSenseContains() property can be used to prevent the filtering process from being affected by upper or lower case letters.

Tip: app will automatically hide the search bar at the very top of the list – you’ll need to pull down gently to reveal it
