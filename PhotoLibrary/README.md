# Photo Library 

- Coordinators act as a bridge between the ViewController and SwiftUI. And it makes the photo selected from PhotoLibrary displayed on the screen. 
- didFinishPicking brings up the selected photo.

⭐️This process is carried out in 3 steps.
1-Tell the picker to go
2-Exit if no selection is made
3-If there is a picture of it we can use it
